PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net filter_0/m_lbuff/genblk1[2].ram_indices_counter/write_enable_reg[3]__0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin filter_0/m_lbuff/genblk1[2].ram_indices_counter/write_enable_reg[3]_i_2__1/O, cell filter_0/m_lbuff/genblk1[2].ram_indices_counter/write_enable_reg[3]_i_2__1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

REQP-1709#1 Warning
Clock output buffering  
PLLE2_ADV connectivity violation. The signal ddr3_mig_inst/u_ddr3_mig_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/pll_clk3_out on the ddr3_mig_inst/u_ddr3_mig_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i/CLKOUT3 pin of ddr3_mig_inst/u_ddr3_mig_mig/u_ddr3_infrastructure/plle2_i does not drive the same kind of BUFFER load as the other CLKOUT pins. Routing from the different buffer types will not be phase aligned.
